# gmail-desktop

For whatever reason, trying to manage my email in one of 100 browser tabs doesn't work for me. Maybe you're the same. If so, this is for you.

## Features

* Basically just Gmail but as a desktop app
* Native email notifications
* Unread message count in app icon

## Installation

Download a release or build yourself.

```
git clone git@github.com:rmcvey/gmail-desktop.git
cd gmail-desktop
npm install
npm run pack
npm run dist
# built application will be in dist/ directory
```
